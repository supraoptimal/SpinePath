Timing of Operation

Importance:

Deciding when to perform spine surgery is one of the most sensitive aspects of patient management. There are no formal guidelines within the Hospital Authority, and expert opinions often differ. Additionally, logistical and administrative factors can heavily influence the decision.

Weighing of Factors:

Each case must be evaluated on its own merits, considering both the clinical urgency and the practical realities of surgical timing. The factors listed above carry different weights depending on the specific circumstances, and the decision to operate should be made with these in mind.

Acute Pathology
Acute Central Cord Injuries with Pre-existing Cervical Spondylosis
In older patients, acute central cord injuries often occur following low-energy incidents, such as a fall from ground level. These injuries typically involve extension trauma to a pre-existing stenotic cervical canal, without significant cervical fractures or instability. Patients usually present with upper limb weakness, altered sensation, and sometimes variable bladder dysfunction [2].

MRI reports often describe findings like "cord compression," "cord oedema," and "myelomalacia," which can be alarming, especially to junior residents. However, historically, these injuries have been managed conservatively [2], with early studies showing that 77% of patients achieve full motor recovery, typically within the first three weeks [3].

Some authors suggest early decompression due to ongoing spinal cord compression  [4], but these recommendations are based on low-quality evidence [5]. The definition of "early" surgery varies widely in the literature, ranging from less than 8 hours to 4 days post-injury  [6].

Studies comparing early to delayed surgery show no significant difference in outcomes, including neurological and functional recovery, ICU stay length, and even mortality rates [7] [8], with some evidence suggesting delayed surgery may be associated with lower mortality [9].

	•	Medically optimise and consider initial expectant management.

Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES)
Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) is primarily a clinical diagnosis, not solely based on radiological findings. The definition of CES varies in the literature [10], but it generally includes the following symptoms: low back pain, bilateral sciatica, saddle anaesthesia (reduced perianal sensation), altered bladder function leading to painless urinary retention, loss of anal tone, and sexual dysfunction.
A practical definition of CES has been proposed as follows  [11]: CES is a clinical diagnosis resulting from dysfunction of one or more sacral nerve roots (S2 and below). At least one of the following must be present:
	•	Bladder and/or bowel dysfunction
	•	Reduced sensation in the saddle area
	•	Sexual dysfunction
Back and leg pain, along with motor or sensory changes in the lower limbs, are common but not essential for the diagnosis. An MRI is necessary to confirm CES and typically reveals nerve root compression as the underlying cause.

CES can be categorized into two types [12] [13]:

	•	Incomplete CES (CES-I)
	•	Retention CES (CES-R)
 


 Two other categories have been described but less commonly used [12]: 
1. CES suspicious (CESS): This represents bilateral radiculopathy without objective evidence of CES. 
2. CES complete (CESC):  This is characterised by the loss of all cauda equina functions, including absent perianal sensations, a patulous (loose) anus, and an insensate bladder and bowel.

Outcomes are generally more favorable for CES-I than CES-R. Prompt surgery is recommended to prevent the progression from CES-I to CES-R. However, emergency surgery offers limited benefits for those with complete CES-R  [13].

Research by Ahn et al. suggests surgical intervention within 48 hours can improve sensory, motor, urinary, and rectal function, but no significant advantage is gained by performing surgery within 24 hours compared to the 24-48 hour window [14].  
Recommendations: Cauda Equina Syndrome

	•	MR evidence of cauda equina compression + clinical features = Confirmed CES
	•	MR evidence of cauda equina compression – clinical features ≠ CES
Recommendations: Cauda Equina Syndrome

	•	MR evidence of cauda equina compression + clinical features = Confirmed CES
	•	MR evidence of cauda equina compression – clinical features ≠ CES

Trauma (Fracture ± Dislocation)
	Two primary scoring systems guide surgical recommendations for patients with spinal trauma: the SLICS (Subaxial Injury Classification and Severity Scale) and the TLICS (Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score) (see Appendix E & Appendix F)


 Both classifications use two radiological parameters and one clinical parameter. 

	•	Radiological Parameters
	•	Injury morphology 
	•	Discoligamentous Complex (SLICS) /Posterior Ligamentous Complex (TLICS)
	•	As seen on x-ray or MRI

	•	Clinical Parameter
	•	Neurology 

Each parameter is scored, with the total score determining treatment. Scores of ≤3 suggest non-operative treatment, while scores of ≥5 indicate surgery. A score of 4 may lead to either approach.

The STASCIS trial [15] is the most referenced study regarding the timing of surgery for traumatic spinal cord injury. It recommends surgery within 24 hours of injury, as early neurological decompression and stabilisation help prevent secondary cord injury and facilitate rehabilitation. The study showed that patients who underwent surgery within this timeframe had a significantly better chance (OR 2.83, 95% CI: 1.10-7.28) of improving by 2 or more ASIA grades at 6 months. Recent guidelines from AO Spine/Praxis also support decompression within 24 hours to improve neurological outcomes [16].

Neurogenic Shock
Neurogenic shock, distinct from spinal shock, is a distributive shock characterised by hypotension, relative bradycardia, and peripheral vasodilatation. Hypotension can reduce spinal cord blood flow, worsening ischaemia and potentially exacerbating secondary injury. The challenge lies in deciding whether to decompress the cord while the patient is still haemodynamically unstable to address the shock or to stabilise the patient medically before surgery to reduce peri-operative mortality. Currently, there is no consensus in the literature on the optimal timing of surgical decompression in such cases [17].
Recommendations: Spinal Cord Trauma

	•	Stabilised patients can proceed to surgery within 24 hours.
Recommendations: Spinal Cord Trauma

	•	Stabilised patients can proceed to surgery within 24 hours.

Malignancy
Several scoring systems have been developed to assess the operability of patients with spinal metastases. The Tomita score guides treatment goals and surgical strategy based on the primary tumour, visceral metastases, and spinal metastases [18]. The revised Tokuhashi score incorporates the patient’s general condition, the resectability of major organ metastases, and neurological involvement to predict prognosis [19]. The SINS (Spine Instability Neoplastic Score) evaluates the structural stability of the spine to recommend surgical intervention (Appendix C) [20]. However, with advances in oncological therapies, life expectancy for many cancer patients has increased, reducing the relevance of these traditional scoring systems.

The NOMS framework (Appendix A) now guides the management of spinal metastases, considering four key factors: neurological, oncological, mechanical, and systemic [21].
	•	Neurological: The degree of metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) is graded based on MRI T2 axial images at the site of greatest compression (Appendix D) 
	•	Oncological: Tumours are classified as radiosensitive or radioresistant based on their response to conventional external beam radiotherapy (cEBRT) using one or two radiation beams without conformational techniques.
	•	Mechanical: Structural stability is assessed using SINS.
	•	Systemic: No universally accepted survival prediction scoring system exists. While newer algorithms have been developed to prognosticate metastatic spinal disease [22], decisions are primarily based on the patient’s ability to tolerate intervention, considering their tumour burden and comorbidities. Surgery may be considered if effective pharmacotherapy is available post-operatively for systemic tumour control and if systemic progression is not rapid enough to hinder post-operative recovery [21].

Advances in radiotherapy have made high-grade MESCC from radiosensitive tumours treatable with cEBRT and low-grade MESCC from radioresistant tumours treatable with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Therefore, the indication for surgical stabilisation can be considered separately from the indication for surgical decompression, although these procedures are often performed together.
Recommendations: Malignancy

	•	Determine the need for surgical vs. oncological intervention.
	•	Assess if surgical stabilisation is required.
	•	Evaluate if the patient can tolerate surgery and recovery.
	•	Engage with the patient’s expectations and preference for surgery.

	•	Assess if surgical stabilisation is required.
	•	Evaluate if the patient can tolerate surgery and recovery.
	•	Engage with the patient’s expectations and preference for surgery.
Infection
Pyogenic Infections

Pyogenic spinal infections encompass a range of conditions, including:

	•	Discitis: Infection of the intervertebral discs.
	•	Spondylitis (Vertebral Osteomyelitis): Infection of the vertebral bone.
	•	Spondylodiscitis: Infection of both discs and vertebrae.
	•	Epidural Abscess: Abscess formation in the epidural space.

Most cases of infective spondylitis can be managed non-operatively with systemic antibiotics after a septic work-up and tissue biopsies [23] [24].

General Indications for Surgery [23] [24]:
	•	Spinal epidural abscess 
	•	Progressive neurological deficits (due to cord or cauda equina compression) 

Relative Indications [23]:
	•	Uncertain diagnosis (surgically obtaining specimens)
	•	Failed conservative treatment 
	•	Progressive spinal deformity with mechanical instability 

Tuberculous Infections

Spinal tuberculosis (TB) presents variably, often with a slow and insidious progression. Acute surgical intervention is less common, except in specific circumstances.

Spinal TB is classified as either complicated or uncomplicated, with complications involving instability, deformity, or neurological deficits [25].

Treatment:

	•	Chemotherapy (Anti-TB Treatment): The primary treatment for both complicated and uncomplicated spinal TB [26]. Even in cases with a cold abscess, chemotherapy is generally sufficient. Surgical drainage is recommended only if there is respiratory distress, dysphagia from a cervical paravertebral abscess, or a large psoas abscess causing a hip pseudo-flexion deformity [27].


Potential Indications for Surgery [28]:

Chemotherapy factors:
	•	Lack of response to chemotherapy
	•	Recurrence of infection
	•	Severe weakness at presentation
	•	Static or worsening neurological deficits despite chemotherapy	

Mechanical factors:
	•	Instability
	•	Incapacitating Pain
	•	Deformities

Recommendations: Infection

	•	Uncomplicated infections can be treated with anti-microbial therapy.
	•	Collections can drained percutaneously where technically feasible.

Patient Preparation

Neurological Assessment 

The ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) Impairment Scale is the standard tool for assessing neurological function in spinal cord injuries [30]. While a full assessment may not always be feasible in acute cases, its principles are still applicable.

The first step is to check for the presence of spinal shock, which can hinder accurate ASIA classification [31]. Spinal shock is characterised by flaccid, areflexic paralysis with an absent bulbocavernosus reflex. This condition is distinct from neurogenic shock and typically resolves within 48 hours. The return of the bulbocavernosus reflex indicates the end of spinal shock.

ASIA Impairment Scale
 (Refer to the Appendix G for detailed classification) 
	•	Exclude persistent spinal shock
	•	Check for the bulbocavernous reflex.

	•	Determine Neurological Level of Injury (NLI)
	•	Test pin prick sensation in descending manner on one side of the body.
	•	If abnormal sensation is found, test the same dermatome on the contralateral side.
	•	Test other sensory modalities (e.g., touch) to identify the most caudal intact dermatome.
	•	Test key muscles at level corresponding to sensory level and at additional levels rostral and caudal to identify motor level
	•	The most caudal muscle with a grade ≥3 and all muscles rostral with a grade 5.
	•	If no myotome is present, the motor level is presumed to be same as the sensory level.

	•	Determine Presence of Sacral Sparing
	•	S4-5 (Gold Standard) sensation for light-touch and pin-prick
	•	Deep anal pressure (DAP), voluntary anal contraction (VAC)
           
Corticosteroids

Trauma
The hypothesised action of steroid administration in spinal cord injury (SCI) is to reduce "secondary injury" by attenuating the inflammatory cascade, primarily by halting lipid peroxidation [32]. The NASCIS (National Spinal Cord Injury Study) trials, conducted between 1984 and 1997, examined the clinical efficacy of high-dose methylprednisolone (MP) in acute SCI [33].

However, the NASCIS trials have faced criticism for their methodology, particularly the use of post-hoc analysis, and subsequent trials have struggled to replicate their findings [34]. Moreover, a 48-hour infusion of MP poses risks, including infections, gastrointestinal ulcers, prolonged intensive care stays, and increased mortality [35].

In 2013, the Congress of Neurological Surgeons issued a Level 1 recommendation against using methylprednisolone for acute SCI, citing a lack of Class I or Class II evidence for clinical benefit and inconsistent Class III evidence, likely due to random chance [36]. As a result, high-dose steroids are now considered an option rather than a standard treatment [37].

Malignancy
The use of steroids for metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) is less controversial.  Steroids are indicated to provide analgesia and reduce vasogenic oedema, with the goal of preventing neurological deterioration.  Although evidence on the optimal dosage and duration is limited, one systematic review by Kumar et al. [39] recommended a specific regimen that was associated with fewer adverse events compared to higher-dose regimens.

Consenting

Obtaining valid consent requires ensuring that the patient is fully informed about their treatment options and is free to make a decision without any undue pressure. While this process can be challenging in the case of a patient with an emergent spinal condition, informed consent is still possible if the patient is clearly informed and demonstrates an understanding of the following key points:

	•	The objectives and benefits of the proposed treatment
	•	Realistic expectations regarding outcomes
	•	The risks involved, including any rare but significant complications
	•	Reasonable alternative treatment options

Objectives
The consenting process usually begins by explaining the overall objectives of the surgery. The specific surgical approach, the types of implants used, and the number of spinal levels involved may vary based on intra-operative findings. The main goals of the surgery typically include one or more of the following:

	•	Decompression: Relieving pressure on the spinal cord or nerves.
	•	Stabilization: Providing stability through instrumentation and/or fusion.
	•	Control of Local Tumour or Infection:  Managing or reducing the tumour or sepsis in the affected area.
	•	Obtaining Specimens: Collecting tissue samples for further diagnosis.

The primary benefit of decompression is to prevent further neurological deterioration.  While neurological improvement is possible, it cannot be guaranteed.  Mechanical stabilization may help reduce pain and deformity associated with spinal instability, creating a more favourable environment for nerve function and recovery.  Reducing the tumour or septic load can help control the disease, while intra-operative cultures and histological analysis guide subsequent treatment and prognosis.

Expectations
Managing a patient’s expectations requires a delicate balance. Acute spine patients are often in emotional distress, which can impair their ability to process information.  The challenge is to offer a realistic outlook on their recovery without completely diminishing hope.  Patients with complete or near-complete spinal cord injuries often believe that surgery will lead to dramatic neurological recovery and the ability to walk again.

However, the degree of recovery depends on several factors, including the mechanism and level of injury, age, comorbidities, timing of intervention, and, most crucially, the severity of the neurological injury.

The key factor in predicting neurological outcomes is whether the injury is complete or incomplete, as determined by clinical examination.  Sacral sparing is the most reliable indicator of an incomplete injury [40].  

A thorough initial neurological assessment is crucial for both immediate and long-term management.  However, it is important to recognise that the accuracy of the examination may be compromised by factors such as severe pain, ventilation, sedation, or head injuries, which can hinder reliable communication and participation.Top of FormBottom of Form

Complete Injury

Tetraplegics
	
Among ASIA A patients, only 13% convert to incomplete status by 1 year [41], and even when conversion occurs, it doesn't always lead to significant functional improvement or ambulation [42].  Only about 2.3% of initially complete patients progress to ASIA D. Most patients with complete tetraplegia recover function in 2-3 segments below the initial neurological level.  For example, if motor power is grade 2 at the C5 level (e.g., biceps) at 1 week post-injury, recovery to grade 3 at the caudal motor level (e.g., C6 extensor carpi radialis) is possible [43].

Paraplegics

Complete paraplegics typically experience less recovery compared to tetraplegics. The conversion rate from ASIA A to ASIA B or D is about half that of tetraplegics, possibly due to thoracolumbar injuries being associated with higher-energy trauma or due to initial assessment challenges in tetraplegics leading to overestimation of impairment  [44].  Most paraplegics (73%) do not experience a change in neurological level 1 year post-injury [45].

Incomplete Injury

Patients with incomplete injuries have a higher likelihood of improvement. Functional walking, defined as independent ambulation with or without aids, is more likely in ASIA B patients if their injury preserves light touch and pinprick sensations, suggesting that the corticospinal tracts are more likely intact [37].  Appendix H provides details on long-term ambulation potential based on impairment grade, injury level, and age.

Recovery Time

Most neurological recovery occurs within the first 6-9 months for both incomplete and complete spinal cord injuries, with improvement typically plateauing at 12-18 months [43] [40] [45] [46].  Generally, rapid and early improvement correlates with greater final recovery [3].

Complications
Complications are generally higher in emergency spine surgeries compared to elective procedures. Unforeseen circumstances can make operative time unpredictable. Patients may be in a state of systemic inflammation, impairing haemostasis. Prolonged intubation could lead to ventilatory dependency and respiratory failure in already frail patients.
Patients often seek risk estimates for complications. While general figures (Appendix I) can be provided, they vary depending on the source and may not precisely reflect an individual patient's risk [47].

Legal Considerations
 According to the ruling in Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board [2015] UKSC, "material risks" must be discussed with the patient. These are risks that a reasonable patient would find significant in deciding to accept or reject surgery [48].  Standard consent forms list risks, but explaining these risks in detail is crucial, as they vary with the type of spinal surgery, pathology, approach, levels involved, and presence of instrumentation.

This principle in Montgomery has been echoed in Section 7 “Legal Principles on Informed Consent” Version 4.0 from Hospital Authority Head Office.  

This was also iterated in the Code of Professional Conduct of the Medical Council of Hong Kong, which states that the explanation of the risks should cover not only significant risks but also risks of serious consequences even though the probability is low.  


Key Complications in Emergency Spine Surgery

	•	Haemorrhage Bleeding is often more significant in emergency spinal operations due to conditions like infections, malignancy, and inflammation (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis), which can induce abnormal vasculature. Hypervascular tumours, such as those from renal cell carcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma, pose a high risk of intra-operative bleeding.  Ideally, these tumours are embolized pre-operatively, but this is not always feasible due to the urgency of neurological compression.  Heavy bleeding may necessitate massive transfusions, potentially leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemodynamic instability and death.  If bleeding cannot be controlled, premature termination of surgery may be required.

	•	Neurological Deficits Damage to neurological structures can occur due to positioning, instrumentation, manipulation, or spinal cord ischaemia, leading to nerve injury ranging from neuropraxia to neurotmesis. Risks should be explained in clear terms, avoiding medical jargon. For example, describe risks as potential weakness, paralysis, loss of sensation, or the onset of new abnormal sensations, as well as possible gait difficulties, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction.

	•	Dural Tears The dura is the outer membrane of the spinal cord, containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and extending to the S2 level. Tears can be traumatic or iatrogenic, especially during decompression when the dura adheres to the ligamentum flavum or pathological tissue. Unrepaired dural tears can lead to CSF leaks, causing postural headaches, dizziness, and vomiting, and in the longer term, complications like fistula formation, meningitis, wound infections, and CSF collections.

	•	Persistent, Recurrent, and New Pathology In cases of spinal metastases, the goal is often palliative rather than curative. Surgery aims to relieve pain, prevent neurological deterioration, maintain spinal stability, and improve quality of life. Complete excision with clear margins is rarely feasible, and tumour recurrence or progression can occur despite surgery and adjuvant therapy. Similarly, incomplete drainage of infections may leave microscopic foci that persist despite antibiotics. Stabilisation implants may become infected, leading to biofilm formation. Decompressive surgeries can cause mechanical instability, and issues such as implant loosening, breakage, or migration, as well as delayed or failed fusion, can arise. Adjacent segment degeneration may also develop post-fusion.

Reasonable Alternatives
Spine surgery carries significant risks, and its benefits are not always guaranteed.  While the indications for surgery may often be clear, the decision can be controversial and may differ among experts.  Patients should always be informed of non-operative treatment options, regardless of how urgent or surgically amenable the pathology may appear.

	•	Traumatic Cases: Can often be managed with orthoses and immobilisation.
	•	Infections: May be treated with antimicrobials or percutaneous drainage.
	•	Malignancies: Can be managed with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

However, patients should also be informed about the natural progression of the disease and the potential consequences of opting for non-operative treatment.


Legal basis

A common question is whether patients should always be presented with surgical options, even if the surgeon believes the risks outweigh the benefits.

In the case McCullough v Forth Valley Health Board [2023], it was affirmed that discussions about treatment options are matters of professional judgement, following Bolam’s test. This means it is within the clinician’s discretion to determine whether a particular treatment is reasonable [50].

Although UK Supreme Court decisions are not binding in Hong Kong, they are highly persuasive. Therefore, clinicians are not considered negligent for not discussing alternative treatments, provided their actions are supported by a responsible body of medical opinion and their decision-making is not illogical.


   


Theatre Preparation

The on-call resident may be tasked with assisting in theatre preparation and arranging implants. If surgery is scheduled for the same night of admission or early the next morning, implants must be retrieved and sterilised quickly. Theatre nurses typically require the desired implants to be clearly listed under "Remarks" in the CMS EOT booking.

The Sterile Supplies Department (SSD) generally stocks most instruments needed for acute spine conditions. However, if non-stock or non-consigned implants are required, coordination with Sales Representatives will be necessary to ensure timely delivery.

Additionally, a post-op ICU bed reservation will be needed for most acute spine cases.
